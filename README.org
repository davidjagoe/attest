* Introduction

@test (pronounced attest) is a helper script for testing Asterisk AGI
scripts. It interfaces with the AGI script in the same way as Asterisk
would, and uses ruby's test/unit to assert that the (send, expect)
script it is given behaves as specified. It is useful for regression
testing and test driven development. 

The AGI script does *not* have to be implemented in Ruby.

* Example Test

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
class ExampleTest < AsynchronousAsteriskTest
  
  def test_answer_and_hangup
    test_script = 
      [["\n", "ANSWER"],
       ["200 result=0", "HANGUP"],
      ]
    init('./example.agi', [], test_script)
    run_script
  end
end
